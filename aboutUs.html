          <p><b>Theatre for the Young of Art</b> continues to celebrate the magic of making theatre in Mount Vernon and Lisbon, as they continue their offering theatre workshops to area youth. Since 2002 Odyssey has offered twice a year theatre workshops for young theatre artists of every age- from six years of age to 76 years of age- a Holiday Theatre Workshop and a Summer Drama Workshop. The Holiday Workshop brings together adults from MVL Community Theatre with students in grades 1st-12th, for a kind of "Ages on Stages" collaboration in which the stage is shared as equals. This past holiday seasons's Babes in Toyland brought together seventy artists, the longest in kindergarten, the oldest 76 years young, each a student of theatre, ready to learn, to support on another, and yes, ready to play)it is called a "play" after all. The Summer Drama Workshop is intended for students 1st through High School. What is unique is that each of the actors is treated as an equal, no matter their age, their level of experience or ability. The key to Odyssey's success is a genuine working respect for one another, for self, for play.
            What is innovative about the Odyssey Theatre Holiday Show is that it not only brings together this wide range of actors to work together , but also has as the goal to mount work that intends to truly captivate and to "WOW" the audience. As one second grader suggested: We don't want them to say it's cute, because that just means that it wasn't any good, but that they love us anyway. We want them to think it's GREAT!
            It's the "one room school house" with students of all ages learning from one another, in fact, teaching one another… relying on one another! WE say: if you need me, I will be there. It's a promise that is honored from first rehearsal to the close of the play. From the oldest to the youngest, we are in it together… to lean, to love, to create… and to make the impossible magic of theatre a reality. I look forward to seeing you join us in the making of magic in our next workshop.
