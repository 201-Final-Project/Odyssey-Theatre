# Project Requirements

This website is giving the Children's Odyssey Theatre a public facing resource for those interested in learning more about or becoming involved with the theatre.  This will impact actual members of the Mount Vernon community and surrounding areas.  This site should boost the number of participants in the theatre.  
This site will allow users to sign up to participate in productions and internships.  It also provides a medical waiver form to be filled out.  The site includes info on past productions, a page of FAQs, and an ability to donate to thetheatre via paypal or venmo.  
Our app will not include videos of productions, or any games.
As a stretch goal we'd like to add a ticket box office and a user account feature to the page.
